# Python Curriculum
The intro to python for the CGMSP activity.  
For basic python (functions, variables, etc.) see [this file](basic/basic.md) for file operations, see [this file](file/readme.md)   
Once you are done with this, you can learn to make an asteroids like game in python with pygame. To do that, see [here](https://github.com/CGMSP/python-graphics-curriculum).
